## Overview
This project explores a comprehensive wine dataset aggregated from open web sources, combining detailed wine product information with user ratings collected over a five-year period (2017–2021). The dataset spans wines from multiple countries, regions, and wineries, offering rich descriptive attributes that enable in-depth analysis of wine characteristics and consumer preferences.
The goal of this project is to apply data mining and machine learning techniques to:
- Predict wine types
- Discover hidden relationships among wine attributes
- Understand how characteristics such as grape varieties, alcohol content, body, acidity, and food pairings interact.

## Methods & Techniques
Multiple machine learning and data mining techniques were applied to the dataset, including:
- Classification Models
  - J48 Decision Tree
  - JRip Rule-Based Classifier
  - Random Forest
  - Bagging
  - Boosting
  - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Association Rule Mining
  - Apriori algorithm
- Clustering
  - K-Means clustering
These methods were selected to evaluate predictive performance, uncover attribute relationships, and explore underlying data structures.
